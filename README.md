my-linux-utils
==============

Some scripts that makes me feel more comfortable and efficient in my linux box.

This repo is intended to be just my personal backup of those scripts but not  something useful for any other people. But if it isn't so, I'd like to know :-)

banshee-play-pause.sh
----------------------

Banshee has no command switch that can function as Play/Pause button, but it has one switch (--play) to start and the other (--stop) to stop playing.

This simple script tries to figure out whether banshee plays something or not and then stops/starts playing accordingly. 

I use this script to play/pause Banshee using X86AudioPlay shortcut in my WM (Xfce).
